In fact, in 2012, Justin Girard, discovered and published \\n        landmark work in the field of 'concurrent markov decision processes'. What this means, to most people, is that Justin discovered a way to make an uncountable amount of robots study \\n        streaming data together.</p>\\n        <br>\\n        <h2>Today we predict the stock market</h2>\\n        <p>Imagine you had a team of robots watching and analyzing each security you cared about. In 2016, after consulting for only a few years, Justin retired and founded Pax Financial, and FleetOps. Today he is\\n        granting access to one of the streaming algorithms he used to predict the market. Today, Justin advises the Pax Financial team and the FleetOps team.</p>\\n        <br>\\n        <h2>How does it work</h2>\\n        <ul>\\n        <li>1. Save your API Key</li>\\n        <li>2. Download the user plugin for Chrome</li>\\n        <li>(or) 3. Access your API in python</li>\\n        <li>4. Start saving your free data, and see the results for yourself</li>\\n        </ul>\\n\\n        <p> This information generates profit.
